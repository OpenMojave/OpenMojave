> VERY EARLY STAGES this is a hobby side project 

This is intended to be an open-source re-implementation of Fallout: New Vegas that is capable of running and using the original game assets (You'd have to get these yourself of course) 

I'm creating this in order to allow the game to take advantage of newer hardware as the game is still a 32bit game and is slowly running into issues with newer hardware as it ages.

I am writing this using *Rust*, I intend for it to be a semi drop in replacement for the original game *give or take*
